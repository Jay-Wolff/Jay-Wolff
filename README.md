### Here is a little bit about me:
I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Lehman College, following the completion of my Bachelorâ€™s degree with a double major in Computer Science and Computer Graphics and Imaging. My professional experience includes roles as a Tableau Dashboard Developer and Adjunct Lecturer at Lehman College.

Upon completing my Master's degree, I aim to transition into a career in Software Engineering or Data Analytics, with a particular interest in developing interactive experiences.

My current research focuses on enhancing accessibility within virtual environments. I am developing a navigable realm designed specifically for individuals with visual impairments, utilizing 8D audio to create immersive auditory landscapes that aid in navigation and object identification.
